## üìå Project Background

This dashboard project was developed to  highlights operational challenge faced by a retail distribution company in the US. The business manages thousands of product orders across multiple regions and relies heavily on external shipping companies to fulfil deliveries.


### üéØ Target Stakeholders:
- **Logistics & Operations Teams** ‚Äì to track delivery timelines, volume, and bottlenecks.
- **Sales & Marketing** ‚Äì to identify demand patterns by region and product.
- **Executive Leadership** ‚Äì to monitor performance KPIs and support strategic decisions.

## üßæ Executive Summary

This project analyses over 5,000 supply chain transactions to uncover operational patterns and fulfilment performance across regions and product categories. The business maintains a strong 99.48% delivery rate, with Binders and Paper showing the highest undelivered volumes, highlighting areas for inventory and logistics attention. The Central region has the longest average processing time at 4.03 days, suggesting operational improvement opportunities. Shipping method analysis shows a clear customer preference for Standard and Economy shipping, which together make up more than 77% of all deliveries. This dashboard provides stakeholders with visibility into fulfilment trends, shipping method adoption, and delivery statuses to support operational decision-making.

## üîç Insights Deep-Dive

### Product Fulfilment
- Binders and Paper(office supplies) are top-shipped products but contribute most to undelivered volumes.
- Storage and Accessories also show moderate delivery issues worth monitoring.

### Regional Analysis
- The West accounts for the largest share of orders (32.16%), followed by the East (27.97%).
- Central region has the longest average processing time (4.06 days), indicating fulfilment inefficiency.

### Carrier Performance
- COSCO dominates shipment volume (60.05%), suggesting a need to evaluate service risk and performance.
- Other carriers like APM Maersk and Hapag Lloyd offer opportunity for diversification.

### Delivery Timing
- 4,983 orders have been successfully delivered.
- 93 remain unshipped, and 49 are currently in transit (Delivery Ongoing)
- The majority of shipments follow standard or economy fulfilment timelines; there is no classification for ‚ÄúLate Shipping‚Äù in the current dataset

---

## ‚úÖ Recommendations

- **Diversify shipping partners** to reduce reliance on COSCO and improve delivery flexibility.
- **Streamline fulfilment in the Central region** by reviewing warehouse operations and staffing.
- **Prioritise inventory and stock control** for Binders and Paper to reduce backlog.

## üß≠ Clarifying Questions, Assumptions, and Caveats

### Questions for Stakeholders Prior to Project Advancement
- What are the current SLAs in place with each shipping partner?
- How are undelivered volumes currently prioritised or followed up?
- Are there region-specific challenges (e.g. infrastructure, warehousing) impacting performance?

### Key Assumptions and Caveats
- Delivery timestamps are assumed accurate and aligned with operational cut-offs.
- Analysis focuses on orders fulfilled between 2018 and 2021 as per available data.
- Region-based processing times assume equal operational capacities across sites.
